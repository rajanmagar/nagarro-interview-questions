###### 1. He asked me to choose 2 favorite topic from javascript. Ater thinking, I picked `Arrow Function` & `Destructuring`. On that he asked me to write 2 example where Arrow Function make sense over `Regular Function` and vice versa.

#### Answer: 
1st example is `map` Array method.
```javascript
const arr = [1,2,3,4];
const double = arr.map(num => num * 2);
console.log(double) 
â–¶ [2,4,6,8]
```
We can achieve same with regular function too but we have to use `curly brackets {}` and `return` keyword because it is not implicit like in Arrow function which makes code cleaner.
```javascript
const arr = [1,2,3,4];
const double = arr.map(function(num) {
return num * 2
};
console.log(double) 
â–¶ [2,4,6,8]
```
2nd example is `addEventListener` event. Regular function in events will return the element on which it used.
```javascript
[Element].addEventListener("click", function() {
    console.log(this)
})
â–¶ Element
```
While Arrow function in events will point to global scope hence return window object for this.
```javascript
[Element].addEventListener("click", () => console.log(this))
â–¶ Window
```
